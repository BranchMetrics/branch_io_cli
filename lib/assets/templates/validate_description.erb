This command validates all Universal Link domains configured in a project without making any
modification. It validates both Branch and non-Branch domains. Unlike web-based Universal
Link validators, this command operates directly on the project. It finds the bundle and
signing team identifiers in the project as well as the app's Associated Domains. It requests
the apple-app-site-association file for each domain and validates the file against the
project's settings.

Only app targets are supported for this command. By default, it will validate the first.
If your project has multiple app targets, specify the <%= option :target %> option to validate other
targets.

All parameters are optional. If <%= option :domains %> is specified, the list of Universal Link domains in
the Associated Domains entitlement must exactly match this list, without regard to order. If
no <%= option :domains %> are provided, validation passes if at least one Universal Link domain is
configured and passes validation, and no Universal Link domain is present that does not pass
validation.

By default, all build configurations in the project are validated. To validate a different list
of configurations, including a single configuration, specify the <%= option :configurations %>
option.
