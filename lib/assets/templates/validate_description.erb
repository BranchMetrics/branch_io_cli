This command validates all Branch-related settings for a target in an Xcode project,
including validation of the apple-app-site-association file from each domain.
Multiple targets may be validated by running the command multiple times using
the <%= option :target %> option. Test targets are not supported.

For each Branch key present in the Info.plist, it retrieves the settings from Branch's
system. If the information cannot be retrieved (or if the `branch_key` is not present),
an error is recorded. If the <%= option :live_key %> or <%= option :test_key %> option is present,
the set of all keys used by the target must exactly match the options.

All domains and URI schemes configured for the target must include all domains
and URI schemes configured for all keys used by the target. Other domains or
URI schemes may also be present in the project.

This command validates all Universal Link domains configured in an application target
without making any modification. It validates both Branch and non-Branch domains. Unlike
web-based Universal Link validators, this command operates directly on the project. It
finds the bundle and signing team identifiers in the project as well as the app's
Associated Domains. It requests the apple-app-site-association file for each domain
and validates the file against the project's settings.

By default, all build configurations in the project are validated. To validate a different list
of configurations, including a single configuration, specify the <%= option :configurations %> option.

If <%= option :domains %> is specified, the list of Universal Link domains in the Associated
Domains entitlement must exactly match this list, without regard to order, for all
configurations under validation. If no <%= option :domains %> are provided, validation passes
if at least one Universal Link domain is configured for each configuration and passes
validation, and no Universal Link domain is present in any configuration that does not
pass validation.

All parameters are optional.
